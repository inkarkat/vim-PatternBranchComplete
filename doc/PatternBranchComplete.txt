DESCRIPTION				   *PatternBranchComplete-description*

Some workflows gather several alternative (often mostly literal) pattern
branches as the current search pattern, for example to refactor / rename a
constant, class, and corresponding getters in one go. During this, it can be
useful to quickly recall words from the individual search alternatives in
insert mode completion, e.g. when writing / adapting corresponding API
documentation.

This plugin offers quick access to literal strings from the regular expression
branches of the current search pattern (|quote/|) via an alternative insert
mode completion.

SEE ALSO								     *

- The |SearchAlternatives.vim| plugin (vimscript #4146) offers mappings and
  commands to quickly add alternative branches to the current search pattern,
  facilitating a workflow that then also benefits from the completion source
  offered by this plugin.
- Check out the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

==============================================================================
USAGE						 *PatternBranchComplete-usage*

In insert mode, invoke the pattern branch completion via CTRL-X \ |.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

							      *i_CTRL-X_\_bar*
CTRL-X \ |		Split the current search pattern (|quote/|) into
			toplevel branches (/foo\|bar/ -> foo, bar), remove
			regular expression artifacts like position atoms
			(|/ordinary-atom|) and |/multi|s, and unescape special
			characters. In those branches that now (depending on
			the pattern complexity) resemble mostly normal text,
			find branches whose contents match the keyword before
			the cursor. First, a match at the beginning is tried;
			if that returns no results, it may match anywhere.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				  *PatternBranchComplete-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-PatternBranchComplete
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim PatternBranchComplete*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				  *PatternBranchComplete-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.035 or
  higher.
- Requires the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin (vimscript #3914), version 1.11 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				 *PatternBranchComplete-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
configvar
						 *PatternBranchComplete-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(PatternBranchComplete) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-x><Bslash><Bar> <Plug>(PatternBranchComplete)
<
